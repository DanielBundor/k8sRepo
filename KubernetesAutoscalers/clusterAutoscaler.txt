The Cluster Autoscaler is a tool that allows you to increase or decrease the size of a Kubernetes cluster. With Cluster Autoscaling, a CRD (custom resource definition) toollike Karpenter can help you autoscale your Kubernetes cluster with the below listed components making up its architecture, which can be described as follows:

1. Unscheduled pods - pods awaiting scheduling.

2. Pending pods - pods awaiting deployment.

3. Exisiting capacity - capacity available to the kubernetes cluster.

4. Just-in-time capacity - a capacity strategy used to increase efficiency and decrease the autoscaling of a Kubernetes cluster. 

5. Optimized capacity - capacity that has been optimized by the cluster and in full use.
